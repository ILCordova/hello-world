back to what I love
Hello world,
I initially went to college for two years with intentions to get a Computer Science degree.  I pursued other wonderful life priorities and my degree was put on hold.  Many years later I would like to accomplish that dream.

This feels like a good place to start.  Looking forward to learning.
That's all for now.

Leslie
